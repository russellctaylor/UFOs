#UFO Analysis
#Overview of Project:
#The purpose of this analysis is to allow users to filter multiple criteria to search for recorded UFO sightings of the first couple weeks of 2010.
#Results
#The is now a webpage where users can do a search by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the object.  In order to perform a search the user will be able to fill out the desired fields and click enter to get the results.
#Summary
#The main draw backs to this page is that there is only two weeks of data which is not much.  Also directions on the web page could be a little more clear on how to operate it.  I would recommend include directions on the page and how to operate it.  I would recommend a larger database because a lot of searches come back with nothing. Also include after a search when no results comes back, web page should state something like no results and to try again.
